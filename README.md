I will be making a simple game that utilizes RGB color manipulation. The idea is that the user will be shown a color swatch and will from then guess what the RGB values of that swatch are. They will be given the primary colors and their repsective RGB values as a reference to base their guess off of. I am still determining how a leaderboard will be ranked, if it will be by who guessed each color most accurately, or by overall accuracy. After a player has finished playing, their scores and associated colors will be posted to a leaderboard based on the accuracy of the user's guesses in comparison to the actual RGB values of the given color.

Below is the sketch for the login page, a gamestate, and the leaderboard/end page.

Also, I hope it doesn't matter too much that I overrode the old text I had from the Github assignment. Sorry about that, I promise I had it.
