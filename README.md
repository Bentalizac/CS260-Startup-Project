I will be making a simple game that utilizes RGB color manipulation. The idea is that the user will be shown a color swatch and will from then guess what the RGB values of that swatch are. They will be given the primary colors and their repsective RGB values as a reference to base their guess off of. I am still determining how a leaderboard will be ranked, if it will be by who guessed each color most accurately, or by overall accuracy. After a player has finished playing, their scores and associated colors will be posted to a leaderboard based on the accuracy of the user's guesses in comparison to the actual RGB values of the given color.
